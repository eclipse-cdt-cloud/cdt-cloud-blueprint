# Publishing

PRs will trigger a verification build that generates two zip files with mac artifacts.
Download these zips and replace them in this pre-release: <https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/cdt-cloud-blueprint/releases> before triggering a Jenkins Build.
These unsigned dmgs will be used as input for the Jenkins build: https://ci.eclipse.org/theia/job/TheiaCDTCloud/
