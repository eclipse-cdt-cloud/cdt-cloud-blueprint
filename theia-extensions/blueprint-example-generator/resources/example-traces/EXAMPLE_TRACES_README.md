# Workspace with example traces

This workspace contains two example traces licensed under [`Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License`](https://github.com/dorsal-lab/Tracevizlab/blob/3e284690d92435b092204fb14f3d1ec932eea9fb/LICENSE) taken from [here](https://github.com/dorsal-lab/Tracevizlab/blob/3e284690d92435b092204fb14f3d1ec932eea9fb/labs/TraceCompassTutorialTraces.tgz). They can be opened using the [CDT Cloud Theia trace-extension](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/theia-trace-extension).

## Open a trace with the trace view

1. To open a trace a trace server application is required. The Linux version of CDTCloudBlueprint contains the Trace Compass trace server as part of the application image, and it's ready to be used. It requires Java 17 to be installed to run the Trace Compass server. For other platforms, make sure, that the trace server path is set correctly in the Trace Viewer settings (Settings -> Extensions -> Trace Viewer -> Trace Server: Path).

2. Open the trace view (via open command or on the left side of the application)

3. Click on `Open Trace` and select one of the two folders in this workspace

4. This should open the trace and present you with options to inspect the traces
